               I'm a Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo graduate with a degree in Computer Science and a
               few years of professional mobile game development experience. Until recently, I've
               been working as a Java and Android developer for GREE International Entertainment, Inc.
            </p>
            <p>
               I've worked at internships for Amazon SLO and for Hewlett Packard in Roseville
               (my hometown). During some of my time in college I worked a part-time software
               development job at Tapestry Solutions in San Luis Obispo.
            </p>
            <p>
               My most recent programming experience is with Java, but I've also worked on projects
               in C++, C, JavaScript, and ActionScript. I have experience with Android development
               as well as libgdx (a cross-platform mobile development framework in Java). I've also
               done projects in school using technologies like OpenGL and parallel computing with CUDA.
               More recently, I've been exploring other languages and tools in my free time, including
               Haskell, Python, Kotlin, and C# for Unity.
            </p>

               I'm passionate about video games and consider myself an avid gamer with an
               interest in game design. I'm looking for new work now, preferably in PC and
               console game development, but I'm also interested in opportunities to expand
               my programming experience in other fields.
