# Paul's Personal Website
My personal site, a crash course in web dev

## Technology
### Built on Google App Engine
GAE is easy to use at the free tier for a project like this, and it gives me an easily configurable environment with access to additional resources when I need them.

### Flask Backend
Flask is extremely lightweight and easy to use for small projects.  I'm also using the provided Jinja2 templating capabilities to easily reuse html.

## Future Additions
### Blog
I'd like to at some point add a blog for posting personal/professional updates. This would be more of a web development learning project than a fully functional blog. I also like to write opinion/review pieces on video games and other media, which currently live elsewhere but could be incorporated into my own blog.
